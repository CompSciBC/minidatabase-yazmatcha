This was a tricky assignment and took me a while to fully understand how to implement. I think I’m still getting the hang of when to use pointers and how to use the different methods with vectors and the binary search trees. It’s also still hard to know when to create a variable to use in a method and what exactly to call it so I don’t get confused with the other variables and data structures. Also updating each of the data structures in each method was challenging. It was difficult to know when to create a new vector as well like with the names that had multiple ids attached to them. I did get some help on the deleteById method because I didn’t fully understand that I needed to use an iterator and how to use it. I also kept getting errors when I tested so I did ask AI for help with the errors and it turned out that I was using clang on my mac instead of clang++. Once I made that switch I my tests were able to run.
